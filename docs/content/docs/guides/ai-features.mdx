ImportCSV includes AI features to make data imports smarter and faster.

## Smart Column Mapping

Automatically suggests which CSV columns map to your schema fields using AI. The system analyzes column names and sample data to provide intelligent mapping suggestions with confidence scores.

When you upload a CSV, the AI:
- Analyzes column names and sample data
- Suggests the best matches for your schema
- Shows confidence scores for each suggestion
- Falls back to string similarity if AI is unavailable

## Natural Language Transformations

Fix validation errors and transform data using simple prompts. Just describe what you want in plain English.

### Common transformations:
- "Fix all email addresses"
- "Convert dates to YYYY-MM-DD format"
- "Format phone numbers as (XXX) XXX-XXXX"
- "Capitalize all names"
- "Remove special characters"
- "Fill empty values with N/A"

### How it works:
1. Click the transformation button in the validation step
2. Type your transformation request
3. Preview the changes with confidence scores
4. Select/deselect specific changes
5. Apply the transformations

## Setup

Enable AI features by providing these props to your CSVImporter:

```tsx
import { z } from 'zod';

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
  email: z.string().email(),
  company: z.string().optional()
});

<CSVImporter
  schema={schema}
  backendUrl="https://your-api.com"  // Your backend API URL
  importerKey="your-importer-key"     // Your importer key
  onComplete={handleComplete}
/>
```

## Backend Configuration

Add this to your backend `.env` file:

```bash
# AI Features (optional but recommended)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
```

The AI features will gracefully degrade if not configured - column mapping will use string similarity and transformations will be unavailable.

## Technology

Built with [BAML](https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml) for reliable AI prompt engineering and OpenAI GPT models. Results are cached in Redis for better performance and cost efficiency.

## Examples

### Fixing validation errors:
When validation errors occur, the AI can automatically fix them:
- Invalid emails are corrected
- Dates are reformatted to match requirements  
- Phone numbers are normalized

### Bulk transformations:
Transform entire columns at once:
- Standardize date formats across all rows
- Clean and format phone numbers
- Normalize text casing
- Remove unwanted characters

The AI understands context and applies appropriate transformations based on the data type and validation rules.
