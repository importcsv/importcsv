<Callout type="info">
**Most users don't need this.** The [cloud offering](https://importcsv.com) provides AI features, admin dashboard, and managed infrastructure without any setup.

This section is for teams who want to self-host the ImportCSV backend on their own infrastructure.

## When to Self-Host

- You need data to stay on your own servers
- You have specific compliance requirements
- You want to customize the backend behavior

## What You'll Deploy

- **FastAPI Backend** - Handles imports, validation, webhooks
- **Admin Dashboard** - Next.js app for managing importers
- **PostgreSQL** - Stores importer configurations and import history
- **Redis** - Job queue for background processing
