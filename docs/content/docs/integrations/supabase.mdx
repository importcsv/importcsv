description: Send imported data directly to your Supabase tables
---

Connect your importer to Supabase to write imported rows directly to your database tables.

## What you'll need

- A Supabase project with a table ready to receive data
- Your project URL (e.g., `https://xyz.supabase.co`)
- A service role key (found in Project Settings → API)

<Callout type="info">
Use the **service role key**, not the anon key. The service role key bypasses Row Level Security, which is required for server-side inserts.
</Callout>

## Setup

{/* TODO: Add screen recording */}

1. Open your importer in the ImportCSV dashboard
2. Go to **Destination** and select **Supabase**
3. Enter your project URL and service role key
4. Select the table you want to import data into
5. Map your CSV columns to table columns (exact matches are mapped automatically)
6. Save your importer

That's it—imported data will now flow directly to your Supabase table.

## Column mapping

ImportCSV automatically maps columns when names match exactly. For columns that don't match, you can manually select which CSV column maps to which table column.

**Context columns** let you inject values that aren't in the CSV, like `user_id` or `organization_id`. These are passed from your app when initializing the importer.
