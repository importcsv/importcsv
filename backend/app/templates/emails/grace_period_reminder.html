<p>Hey,</p>

<p>Your recent payment didn't go through. No worries — you have {{ days_remaining }} day{% if days_remaining != 1 %}s{% endif %} to update your payment method and everything keeps working normally.</p>

<p><a href="{{ app_url }}/settings/billing">Update payment method →</a></p>

<p>If something's wrong, just reply and I'll help sort it out.</p>
